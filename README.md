# Database-HCI-Assessment-Project-2.3
My submission for the NCEA Level 2 standard Database/HCI Assessment Project 2.3 - 91892

My database stores data about students and events on participation day (athletics day at my high school). Users can search, edit and add to the database via a Python program.
